# Onpa
This is an app to stream computer audio over LAN using Pulseaudio module `module-simple-protocol-tcp`.
This app aims to improve [https://github.com/dront78/PulseDroid](PulseDroid) app developed by @dront78.

## Changes done till now
- Converted the app to material design.

## Installation
Run the `install.sh` script in the root directory of the repo to install a small script called `pashare` in `/usr/local/bin` location. This script enables the pulseaudio module on running it.

If you want to change the Monitor Source (if it doesn't work) or the port which `pashare` script by default sends audio via, open the script using vim or any other text editor and edit it.

Download the apk file of Onpa and install it to use it.
Works on Android 5 (Lollipop) or higher.
